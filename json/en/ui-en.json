This idea was first conceived by TheGhostOfInky, but I (SoopaKhell) have made some modifications to the original test. Many of these modifications are minor, for example just changing the phrasing on some questions, some are major (for example, I removed distributism and the whole Georgism tree). These changes were made to make navigating the test easier and, hopefully, to make it more accurate.</p>",
